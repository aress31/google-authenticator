<p>
  This Burp Suite extension turns Burp into a Google Authenticator client. The
  current Google Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) code is automatically computed
  from a given shared secret and applied to bespoke location(s) in relevant
  requests in real-time.
</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Input the <em>shared secret</em> used by the Time-based One-Time Password
    (TOTP) algorithm into Google Authenticator.
  </li>
  <li>
    Input the (regular) expression to match and replace in issued request(s)
    into Google Authenticator. Use the regex
    <em>(?&lt;![\w\d])\d{6,8}(?![\w\d])</em> for optimal results as Google 2FA
    codes are made up of 6 to 8 digits according to the relevant RFCs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure a session handling rule that applies to relevant request(s) and
    invokes this extension.
  </li>
</ol>
