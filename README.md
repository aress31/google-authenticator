## A Burp Suite extension to apply the current Google two-factor authentication (2FA) code to relevant requests.
This Burp Suite extension turns Burp into a Google Authenticator client. The current Google 2FA code is automatically applied to bespoke location(s) in relevant requests.

Further information on two-factor authentication is available at the following links:
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator>
* <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226>
* <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238>

## User interface
![example](images/configuration-1.png)
* Zone 1: Secret shared key, used to generate the Google 2FA code using the TOTP algorithm specified in RFC4226 and RFC6238.
* Zone 2: Regular expression for the session handling rule to match and replace with the current Google 2FA code.
* Zone 3: Google 2FA generated code in real-time.

## Example
### Problem
We have been commissioned to perform a web application penetration test on www.foobar.com. This web application implements a login form incorporating Google 2FA for an additional layer of defence (prevents automated attacks such as brute forcing attacks). The client provided us with testing credentials along with a link to set up the Google Authenticator mobile application to allow for authenticated testing.

A login is performed using the following request (in this example, the `pin` JSON parameter is the Google 2FA).
```
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: foobar.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/504482 Firefox/60.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://foobar.com/login
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 74
Connection: close

{"email":"ares@foobar.com","password":"SuperP@ssw0rd!","pin":"504482"}
```

Following the aforementioned link, we obtain the shared secret (`42TCJUDP94W27YR3`) that the `Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP)` uses to generate the Google 2FA codes.

During testing, we observed that the application is being protected by a `web application firewall (WAF)`, logging our test user out each time a malicious payload is detected or if too many requests are sent in a short period of time. This configuration makes it virtually impossible to take advantage of the Burp Suite automated scan capabilities.

### Solution
1. Input relevant parameters into the Google Authenticator user interface:
    * Shared secret:        `42TCJUDP94W27YR3`
    * Regular expression:   `(?<![\w\d])\d{6,8}(?![\w\d])`

2. `Project options` -> `Sessions` -> `Add` a `Session Handling Rule` -> `Invoke a Burp extension` -> `Google Authenticator: 2FA code applied to selected parameter`.
![example](images/configuration-2.png)

3. Configure the relevant scope for the registered session handling rule.

## Tips
* Use the regex `(?<![\w\d])\d{6,8}(?![\w\d])` for optimal results as Google 2FA codes are made up 6 to 8 digits according to the RFC.
* Restrict the scope of the session handling rule down to the request(s) containing the Google 2FA code only.

## Installation
### Compilation
1. Install gradle (<https://gradle.org/>)
2. Download the repository.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AresS31/GoogleAuthenticator
$ cd .\GoogleAuthenticator\
```
3. Create the jarfile:
```shell
$ gradle fatJar
```

### Burp Suite settings
In the Burp Suite, under the `Extender/Options` tab, click on the `Add` button and load the `GoogleAuthenticator-all` jarfile. 

## Possible Improvements
- [ ] Add additional features.
- [ ] Improve the UI.
- [ ] Reimplement the `IHttpListener` in order to give users more ways of processing requests.
- [ ] Source code optimisation.
